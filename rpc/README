Example of Go RPC over the connection encrypted and authenticated with spipe.

RPC service accepts integer slice from clients and replies with the sum.


1. Generate key file (the key is shared between server and clients):

    $ head -c32 /dev/urandom > rpc.key


2. Start server:

    $ go run server/server.go -a=:8999 -k=rpc.key
    Listening on [::]:8999


3. Run client:

    $ go run client/client.go -a=localhost:8999 -k=rpc.key 1 2 3 4
    Result: 10
    
    $ go run client/client.go -a=localhost:8999 -k=rpc.key 21 10 11
    Result: 42
